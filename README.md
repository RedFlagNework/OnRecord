OnRecord is a platform for anonymous, structured coworker reviews — doing for colleagues what review sites do for restaurants. Right now, you can get more information about the tacos in Terminal C than about the team you might work with for the next three years. We change that.
Our focus is on what it’s like to collaborate with someone — their communication style, team dynamics, and trustworthiness. By giving professionals clear, honest, and retaliation-free insights, we help people make smarter career decisions before committing years to the wrong fit.
Say what it felt like to work with them — clearly, carefully, anonymously.
