# OnRecord

OnRecord lets you review coworkers like reviewing restaurants — safely, clearly, and anonymously.

## Say what it felt like to work with them — clearly, carefully, anonymously.

OnRecord does for coworkers what review sites do for restaurants. You can get more information about the tacos in Terminal C than about the team you might work with for the next three years — we change that.

OnRecord is a platform for anonymous coworker reviews that lets you share what it felt like to work with someone — safely, clearly, and without retaliation.
